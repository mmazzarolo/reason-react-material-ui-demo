# About

This simple project has been my first Reason-React playground.  
It features:

* a stateful component (`App.re`)
* some generic stateless components (`Button.re`, `Select.re`, `TextField.re`)
* Material UI

# Material UI

Material UI is a library built for React, so I used the great [BuckleScript Material UI bindings](https://github.com/InsidersByte/bs-material-ui) for making it compatible with Reason-React.  
Since the BuckleScript Material UI bindings are still a work in progress they are missing some bindings like the `MuiThemeProvider`, so I had to use some nasty css workarounds for styling the components.
